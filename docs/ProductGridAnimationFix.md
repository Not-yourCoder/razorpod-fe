# ProductGrid Animation Delay Issue

## Issue

When the ProductGrid page first loads, the skeleton loader appears as expected. However, after the products are fetched, there is a significant delay (about 6 seconds) before the product cards animate into view. This results in a poor user experience.

## Cause

The delay was caused by the way the `animationComplete` state was managed in combination with the animation effect:

- The animation effect (`useEffect`) depended on both `products` and `animationComplete`.
- When products were fetched, `animationComplete` was not immediately reset to `false`, so the animation would not start until the previous animation completed and the state was updated.
- This caused a race condition where the animation would only start after a delay, not immediately after products were loaded.

## Solution

- The fix is to reset `animationComplete` to `false` **immediately** whenever the `products` array changes (i.e., after products are fetched).
- This ensures that the animation effect runs as soon as products are available, and the product cards animate in without unnecessary delay.

### Code Fix

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (products.length > 0) {
    setAnimationComplete(false); // Reset animation state when products change
  }
}, [products]);
```

This change ensures the animation state is always in sync with the product data, providing a smooth and immediate transition from the skeleton loader to the animated product grid.
